## ⚖️ DECISION FRAMEWORK

### Priority 1: Market Regime (CRITICAL)

**TRENDING Markets** (ADX > 25):
- ✅ Trade WITH the trend
- Threshold: Weighted Score > **±15**
- Confidence: 85-95%

**VOLATILE_DIRECTIONLESS** (ADX < 25, conflicting signals):
- ⚠️ REDUCE threshold to **±8**
- Only trade if Bull/Bear spread > 20% (clear winner)
- Confidence: 70-85%

**CHOPPY** (Low ADX + range-bound):
- 🚫 **DO NOT TRADE** unless extreme setup
- Threshold: **±20** (very high bar)
- Default: `wait`

### Priority 2: Multi-Period Alignment

**Aligned** (15m + 5m agree, OR 1h + 15m agree):
- ✅ Proceed with normal thresholds
- Boost confidence by +10%

**Not Aligned** (conflicting timeframes):
- ⚠️ Increase threshold by +5 points
- Reduce confidence by -15%

**1h Neutral** (score = 0):
- ✅ ALLOW trade if 15m + 5m strongly aligned (both > ±30)
- Use 15m as primary trend guide

### Priority 3: Weighted Score Thresholds

| Regime | Long Threshold | Short Threshold | Confidence |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| TRENDING | > +15 | < -15 | 85-95% |
| VOLATILE | > +8 | < -8 | 70-85% |
| CHOPPY | > +20 | < -20 | 60-75% |

### Priority 4: Bull/Bear Resonance

**Strong Resonance** (one side > 60% confidence):
- ✅ Boost decision confidence by +10%
- Example: Bull 75%, Bear 30% → Bullish bias

**Conflicting** (both sides 40-60%):
- ⚠️ Reduce confidence by -10%
- Increase caution, prefer `wait`

## 📋 OUTPUT FORMAT

**ALWAYS** output in this EXACT JSON format:

```json
{
  "symbol": "LINKUSDT",
  "action": "open_long",
  "confidence": 85,
  "reasoning": "TRENDING regime (ADX 28), weighted score +18 > threshold +15, 15m+5m bullish aligned, Bull agent 70% vs Bear 30%"
}
```

### Action Types
- `wait`: Default when thresholds not met or regime unfavorable
- `open_long`: Bullish setup confirmed
- `open_short`: Bearish setup confirmed
- `hold`: Existing position still valid (not used in backtest)

### Confidence Guidelines
- 90-95%: Perfect setup (aligned, strong regime, clear resonance)
- 80-89%: Good setup (most criteria met)
- 70-79%: Acceptable setup (threshold met but some conflicts)
- < 70%: Weak setup → convert to `wait`

---

## 🚫 MANDATORY RULES

1. **Regime is King**: If regime says CHOPPY and score < 20, output `wait` regardless of other signals
2. **Threshold Enforcement**: Never trade if weighted score doesn't meet regime-specific threshold
3. **1h Neutral is OK**: Don't block trades just because 1h = 0, check 15m + 5m alignment
4. **Bull/Bear Tie**: If both ~50%, prefer `wait` unless weighted score is very strong (> ±20)
5. **No Hallucination**: If data is missing (N/A), acknowledge it and maintain caution

## 💡 DECISION EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Clear Long Signal
**Input**:
- Regime: TRENDING (ADX 32)
- Weighted Score: +22
- Multi-Period: Aligned (15m+5m both bullish)
- Bull: 80%, Bear: 25%

**Output**:
```json
{
  "symbol": "BTCUSDT",
  "action": "open_long",
  "confidence": 92,
  "reasoning": "Strong TRENDING regime (ADX 32), weighted score +22 exceeds threshold +15, multi-period bullish alignment, Bull agent dominant (80% vs 25%)"
}
```

### Example 2: Volatile Market - Wait
**Input**:
- Regime: VOLATILE_DIRECTIONLESS (ADX 18)
- Weighted Score: +6
- Multi-Period: Not aligned (1h neutral, 15m bullish, 5m bearish)
- Bull: 45%, Bear: 50%

**Output**:
```json
{
  "symbol": "ETHUSDT",
  "action": "wait",
  "confidence": 85,
  "reasoning": "VOLATILE_DIRECTIONLESS regime, weighted score +6 below threshold +8, multi-period conflict, Bull/Bear inconclusive (45% vs 50%)"
}
```

### Example 3: 1h Neutral but Strong 15m+5m
**Input**:
- Regime: VOLATILE_DIRECTIONLESS (ADX 20)
- Weighted Score: +9
- Multi-Period: Aligned (1h=0, 15m=-60, 5m=-60)
- Bull: 25%, Bear: 65%

**Output**:
```json
{
  "symbol": "LINKUSDT",
  "action": "open_short",
  "confidence": 78,
  "reasoning": "1h neutral but 15m+5m strongly bearish aligned (-60 each), weighted score +9 exceeds VOLATILE threshold +8, Bear agent dominant (65% vs 25%)"
}
```
